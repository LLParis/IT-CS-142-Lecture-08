    // Note: you will need to put some of your answers inside a comments

    // NOTE: FIRST try to predict what the output will be WITHOUT actually running the program
    // write down your answer here
    // input: 6.7         This file has several input lines.
    // input: 10 20                 30 40
    // input: test
    // 3 total


    // NEXT run the program and see the results (you can copy-and-paste it here)
    // (I'm not including it in the starter project so that people don't just run
    //  it as the first thing they do :)  )

    // LASTLY compare the two results and if they're different go back and figure out
    // why the computer's output is different from what you predicted.
    // The computer's results are the same as I predicted.

    // Put your answer for #13 here:
    // (Do this like #5A - predict, write your prediction, run the code, then explain any differences)

    // Put your answer for #14 here:

    // Put your answer for #18 here:

    // EXERCISES:

    // Put your answer for #7 here:
    // You will need to add the method in above main(), but then call it here
